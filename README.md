# Automated Trading with Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to our community project focused on leveraging machine learning (ML) to revolutionize automated trading. Our goal is to develop robust, transparent, and accessible ML models that can empower individuals and organizations to make informed trading decisions. This project is open-source, welcoming contributions from enthusiasts, experts, and anyone passionate about the intersection of finance and technology.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop ML Models for Trading**: Build and refine machine learning models capable of analyzing market data to predict trends, identify trading opportunities, and automate trading decisions.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that our tools and models are accessible to both beginners and experienced traders, with clear documentation and tutorials.
- **Transparency**: Maintain transparency in model development processes, allowing users to understand how decisions are made.
- **Community-Driven Development**: Foster a collaborative environment where community members can contribute, suggest improvements, and help shape the project's future.

## Getting Started
